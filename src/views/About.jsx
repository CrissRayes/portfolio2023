      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Cristian Ramírez, I&apos;m full stack web developer based in
        Dublin, Ireland. I have been designing and developing web applications
        for over 4 years. I started in Chile as a freelancer and later I worked
        for a software development company in Chile as a frontend developer. My
        knowledge and expertise stem from both my passion for self-learning and
        my participation in two web development bootcamps in Desafío Latam
        Academy. I actively engage in continuous learning and possess a natural
        ability to collaborate effectively in multidisciplinary teams.
